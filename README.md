# The Swift Programming Language: Spanish (Mexico)

Spanish (Mexico) translation of ‘The Swift Programming Language’ book.

This project makes use of [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/installing.html) to compile the markdown to an ePub.

Compiled ePubs can be found in the [releases](https://github.com/Cananito/the-swift-programming-language-spanish-mx/releases) section.

Tagging/versioning will follow the Language’s version numbers.

For revision history, check the official/English [Document Revision History](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/RevisionHistory.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH40-ID459).
